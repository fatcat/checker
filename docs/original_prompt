This is a web application utilizing modern programming techniques and tool chain.

It may be that MCP servers of various kinds will be required to facilitate your
interactibility with the development environment and application web interface.
It is desired that you are able to perform automated testing of the application
as we progress through the development phases, defined below.

At a high level, the application performs network reachability, latency and 
jitter tests to user-configurable hosts. A database of all tests is kept for 
at least one year, so a suitable database type is required to make efficient 
use of storage.

This application will be run inside a container in WSL, so the container must 
be kept up to date whenever new code is created. Use port number 8090 for the 
web server running inside the container. Create the necessary dockerfile and
docker-compose.yaml files to deploy the container.

The development of this app will take place in several phases:

Phase I - This is a tool selection phase. The tools needed for this app include but
are not limited too:
	- suitable database for storage of measurements
	- suitable database for storage of configurable user settings and test hosts
	- web interface toolkit
	- logic programming language, which is the Ruby language
	- a graphing tool that is modern and attractive
	- I do not want to install a separate web server, so select a Ruby built-in web server
	- create directories as necessary to keep the code organized
	- create files as necessary to keep the code modular and organized using modern
		best practices
Phase II - design and development of the module(s) that will perform tests on a
periodic basis. The period is configurable but defaults to once every 5 minutes,
not less than once per minute.
The tests this module will perform include:
	- TCP-based tests; these tests must have a hostname or IP address and a destination
	  port number.
	- UDP-based tests; these have the same definable parameters as the TCP tests
	- Ping tests; these only need a definable hostname or IP
	- The data obtained by each test include
		- reachability
		- latency / round-trip time
		- jitter
	- These data points will be stored for a user definable period defaulting to one year
	- These data points will be graph using the graphing tool defined in phase I
Phase III - design and development of the web interface. The interface will have several
main sections
	- User-definable settings
	- User-definable test hosts
	- Graph displays
	- The graph's display time frame can be user defined or "zoomed"
	- a "dashboard" that shows a summary of the reachability of all the defined hosts

The web interface will use a combination of CSS, HTML and JavaScript/TypeScript/CoffeeScript

This process will be iterative as I am not certain of all of the features required and more
may be revealed as development progresses.
